## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
A friend of mine needed a free customized email extractor to enable to scrape through multiple websites of choice. Also, he needed an email sorted integrated in the extractor to enable him to easily drop (delete) some popular dmain emails e.g. gmails, hotmails, etc. This web extractor will enable anyone to scrape through web pages, extract emails, sort and delete emails from a list of extracted emails.



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This project contains 4 Python files, an sqlite3 file for database, multiple template html files for page rendering, image and css files.    

Also, the project includes configuration files for hosting on a cloud service (I used Heroku free service). 

There is a lot of room for improvements on this project.
